## General Information
- The project is to find the relation between different parameters and charged off loans
- The company wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong            indicators  of default.  The company can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment. 
- The dataset which we are using is the complete loan data for all loans issued through the time period 2007 t0 2011.

## Conclusions
- Exercise caution over loans given to very low and low income groups.
- Reduction of Exposure to poorer graded loans (Grades D,E,F,G).
- Compare the relative LTAI ratio values from the tables provided above to identify a probable default loan application.
- Instead of providing a loan with a term of 60 months with lower instalments, providing a lesser loan amount with a term of 36 months that    matches their LTAI and instalment capacity may reduce default. 
- It is better to provide a higher loan amount to high annual income applicant having a lower LTAI at lower interest rate than providing a lower loan amount to low income applicant having a higher LTAI at a high interest rate
